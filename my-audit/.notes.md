# To Study

1. ERC4626 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626
2. Aave v3 https://aave.com/
3. Uniswap v2 https://uniswap.org/

# Actors

1. Vault Guardians
2. Users aka Investors

# Features and Functionality

## Investor
- deposits ERC20 tokens (currently only LINK, USDC, WETH allowed) into any vault he chooses (can allocate funds into an "investment portfolio" of several different vaults???)
- calls `redeem` or `withdraw` to retrieve tokens from vault

## Vault Guardian
- aims to maximize value of tokens in the vault he manages (1 guardian per vault???)
- sets "investment strategy" to achieve aim
  - investment strategy refers to allocation ratio (VaultShares::s_allocationData) of:
    1. proportion of vault funds to hold
    2. proportion to add as liquidity in Uniswap v2
    3. proportion to provide as lending amount in Aave v3
- in accordance to allocation ratio:
  - deposits and/or withdraws certain amount of tokens from vault into Aave v3 or Uniswap v2
  - holds certain amount of tokens in the vault
- is restricted to only being able to deposit/withdraw tokens into Aave v3, Uniswap v2, or vault, and no other address
- earns a performance fee based on performance of the vault tokens value
- earns DAO tokens (as reward or as voting power???)

## Becoming a Vault Guardian
- any user can become a Vault Guardian by depositing (staking???) an amount of ERC20 tokens into the vault, aka `guardian stake`.
- to stop being a vault guardian, he has to give back all investor deposits (liquidate the vault???) and retrieve his `guardian stake`.

## The DAO
- responsible for updating price parameters (for what??? tokens in the vault??? DAO tokens???)
- gets a cut from performance fee of all vault guardians
- upgrades the protocol???
- how does the governance work???

- Solc Version: 0.8.20
- Chain(s) to deploy to: Ethereum
- Tokens (only 3 allowed asset tokens in system for now; may change in future??)
  - weth: https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2
  - link: https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca
  - usdc: https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48
  - vgt: VaultGuardianToken. This is NOT an asset token. Looks like a governance token that grants votes on the DAO.

# Tests
README.md suggests fork tests were done by the protocol team.
